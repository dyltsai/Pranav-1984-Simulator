# 1984 Simulator

## Aesthetic:
- Grey, bleak architecture; weather is the same every dayâ€”cloudy, no sun.
- Every person is dressed the same.
- Propaganda posters everywhere.
- No music, just ambient sounds and silence.

## Game Story:
- Players start working in the Ministry of Truth. They can be either an editor of history, a surveillance officer, or a propaganda developer.

- At the Ministry of Truth, players interact with typewriters, redactors, and propaganda distribution machines.
  - Each work area holds the potential for eavesdropping or spying on co-workers.

- Telescreens interrupt gameplay randomly with notices or to check player loyalty. If a telescreen catches the player during a rebellious action, suspicion increases.

- Initially, players receive very mundane and repetitive tasks but eventually face ethically conflicting tasks such as rewriting history or creating propaganda.

- Players have a loyalty meter and a rebellion meter. 
  - Increasing the loyalty meter decreases suspicion but aligns you closer with the Party and brings you further from joining the rebellion.
  - Increasing the rebellion meter increases suspicion but brings you closer to joining the rebellion and achieving freedom.
  - Players also have a survival meter that depends on how much food and supplies they have.

- Big Brother AI tracks player actions and raids homes, brainwashing them if too many rebellious activities occur. Rewards such as food or supplies are given for loyal actions.

- Along the way, players collect document fragments that reveal parts of the real truth, which can unlock paths to the rebellion. They also build relationships with NPCs in both the rebellion and the Party, influencing their loyalty or rebellion meters.

- Players engage in doublethink minigames, where they must remember the real truth in the face of the Party's truth. As loyalty increases, players experience distortion where real truths are blurred, while they become clearer as rebellion increases.

## End Game Outcomes:
- **Loyalist Ending:** Player becomes too closely aligned with the Party and is permanently working for Big Brother OR the player becomes too rebellious and gets brainwashed by Big Brother.
- **Rebellion Ending:** Player successfully joins the rebellion but faces a high risk of capture and torture.



## Feedback:
- Line 4: what kind of architecture? How about making an extremely dystopian setting where the buildings are purely functional and have no design/aesthetically pleasing aspects? They could all just be monotone, grey blocks.
- Line 5: How are they dressed? How about pants and a shirt? No graphics of course. Using monotone colors could emphasize the lifelessness of the player and npcs.
- Line 6: What do the posters say? How about "birds are real animals, not drones". You could make references to real conspiracies too, like the moon landing being faked, or the earth being flat
- Line 10: How does the player decide the role they are given? Do they even have control over it or not? How about doing it in a character creation screen. and the joke is that all the options are the same because everyone looks the same. Mwahahaha
- Line 13: Are co-workers NPCs or is this a multiplayer game? What kind of information do you get from spying/eavesdropping and why is this helpful to the player? 
- Line 15: What does 'suspicion' do? At what level of sus does something happen to the player, and what is it that happens? Do different acts yield different amounts of suspicion? 
- Line 17: how long do players get only repetitive tasks? Do they have to do those tasks? What happens if they don't (increase in sus?)? Do the ethically conflicting tasks effect the way the game progresses in any way? The player might get bored of doing mundane and repetitive tasks, especially if there is no benefit/story progression tied to it.
- Line 22: how do players get food/supplies. How necessary are these things, and can they do anything special with the items? Can players/NPCs starve? What happens if they are gone? Maybe the party does something when people mysteriously disappear to cover up their tracks. 
- Line 24: What happens when a home is raided? What happens when the player's home, specifically, is raided? What if they do/don't find anything? What does it mean for the player to be brainwashed? Is it game over at that point? 
- Line 28: How do the distortions manifest to the player? How would the player be confused by the truth vs the party's truth? Is there a visual cue that suggests this is occuring?
- overall: what is the rebellion really? How does the rebellion overthrow Big Brother and save the player? Is there gameplay after you've joined the rebellion/saved the world?
